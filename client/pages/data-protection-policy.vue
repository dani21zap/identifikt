<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">2. GENERAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Consistent    with    industry-leading    security,    Developers    will    maintain    physical, administrative, and technical safeguards, and other security measures (i) to maintain the security   and   confidentiality   of   Information   accessed,   collected,   used,   stored,   or transmitted by a Developer, and (ii) to protect that Information from known or reasonably anticipated  threats  or  hazards  to  its  security  and  integrity,  accidental  loss,  alteration, disclosure, and all other unlawful forms of processing. Without limitation, the Developer will comply with the following requirements:</p>
<p><br></p>

<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">2.1 NETWORK PROTECTION</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers  must  implement  network  protection  controls including   network   firewalls   and   network   access   control   lists   to   deny   access   to unauthorized IP addresses. Developers must implement network segmentation, anti-virus and anti-malware software on end-user devices. Developers must restrict public access only to approved users and carry out data protection and IT security training for everyone with system access.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">2.2 ACCESS MANAGEMENT</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers must establish a formal user access registration process to assign access rights for all user types and services by ensuring that a unique ID is assigned to each person with computer access to Information. Developers must not create or use generic, shared, or default login credentials or user accounts and prevent user accounts from being shared. Developers must implement baselining mechanisms to ensure that at all times only the required user accounts access Information. Developers must  restrict  employees  and  contractors  from  storing  Information  on  personal  devices. Developers  will  maintain  and  enforce  "account  lockout"  by  detecting  anomalous  usage patterns  and  log-in  attempts  and  disabling  accounts  with  access  to  Information. Developers must review the list of people and services with access to Information at least quarterly.  Developers  must  ensure  that  access  is  disabled  and/or  removed  within  24 hours for terminated employees.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">2.3 LEAST PRIVILEGE PRINCIPLE </span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers must implement fine-grained access control mechanisms  to  allow  granting  rights  to  any  party  using  the  Application  and  the Application's  authorized  operators  following  the  principle  of  least  privilege.  Access  to Information must be granted on a "need-to-know" basis.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">2.4 CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers    must    establish    minimum    password requirements   for   personnel   and   systems   with   access   to   Information.   Password requirements must be a minimum of twelve (12) characters, not include any part of the user’s  name,  mix  of  upper-case  letters,  lower-case  letters,  numbers,  and  special characters,  including  minimum  requirements  for  each.  Developers  must  establish  a minimum  password  age  of  1-day  and  a  maximum  365-day  password  expiration  for  all users. Developers must ensure that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required for all user accounts Developer must ensure that API keys provided by EcartAPI are encrypted and only required employees have access to them.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">2.5 ENCRYPTION IN TRANSIT</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers must encrypt all Information in transit with secure protocols  such  as  TLS  1.2+,  SFTP,  and  SSH-2.  Developers  must  enforce  this  security control  on  all  applicable  internal  and  external  endpoints.  Developers  must  use  data message-level  encryption  where  channel  encryption  (e.g.,  using  TLS)  terminates  in untrusted multi-tenant hardware (e.g., untrusted proxies).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">2.6 RISK MANAGEMENT AND INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers  must  have  a  risk assessment  and  management  process  that  is  reviewed  by  the  Developer's  senior management  annually,  which  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  assessment  of  potential threats and vulnerabilities as well as likelihood and impact in order to track known risks. Developers must create and maintain a plan and/or runbook to detect and handle Security Incidents. Such plans must identify the incident response roles and responsibilities, define incident types that may affect EcartAPI, define incident response procedures for defined incident  types,  and  define  an  escalation  path  and  procedures  to  escalate  Security Incidents to EcartAPI. Developers must review and verify the plan every six (6) months and  after  any  major  infrastructure  or  system  change,  including  changes  to  the  system, controls, operational environments, risk levels, and supply chain. Developers must notify EcartAPI  (via  email  to  admin@ecartapi.com)  within  24  hours  of  detecting  a  Security Incident.  It  is  the  Developer’s  sole  responsibility  to  inform  relevant  government  or regulatory  agencies  as  required  by  applicable  local  laws.  Developers  must  investigate each Security Incident, and document the incident description, remediation actions, and associated corrective process/system controls implemented to prevent future recurrence. Developers must maintain the chain of custody for all evidence or records collected, and such documentation must be made available to EcartAPI upon request (if applicable). If a Security Incident occurred, Developers cannot represent or speak on behalf of EcartAPI to any regulatory authority or customers unless EcartAPI specifically requests in writing that the Developer do so.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">2.7 REQUEST FOR DELETION</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers must permanently and securely delete Information upon  and  in  accordance  with  EcartAPI ́s  notice  requiring  deletion  within  30  days  of EcartAPI ́s requests unless the data is necessary to meet legal requirements, including tax or regulatory requirements. Secure deletion must occur in accordance with industry-standard sanitization processes such as NIST 800-88. Developers must also permanently and  securely  delete  all  live  (online  or  network  accessible)  instances  of  Information  90 days after EcartAPI ́s notice. If requested by EcartAPI, the Developer will certify in writing that all Information has been securely destroyed.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">2.8 DATA ATTRIBUTION</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers  must  store  Information  in  a  separate  database  or implement  a  mechanism  to  tag  and  identify  the  origin  of  all  data  in  any  database  that contains Information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">3. ADDITIONAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIC TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">The  following  additional  Security  Requirements  must  be  met  for  Personally  Identifiable Information ("PII"). If an EcartAPI Services API request contains PII, or PII is combined with non-PII, then the entire data store must comply with the following requirements:</p>
<p><br></p>

<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">3.1 DATA RETENTION</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description"> Developers  will  retain  PII  for  no  longer  than  30  days  after  order delivery and only for the purpose of, and as long as is necessary to (i) fulfill orders, (ii) calculate and remit taxes, (iii) produce tax invoices and other legally required documents, and  (iv)  meet  legal  requirements,  including  tax  or  regulatory  requirements.  Developers may retain data for over 30 days after order delivery only if required by law and only for the purposes of complying with that law. Per sections 2.5 (“Encryption in Transit”) and 3.4 (“Encryption at Rest”) at no point should PII be transmitted or stored unprotected.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">3.2 DATA GOVERNANCE</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers must create, document, and abide by a privacy and data handling and classification of policy for their Applications or services, which govern the appropriate conduct and technical controls to be applied in managing and protecting information assets. A record of data processing activities such as specific data fields and how they are collected, processed, stored, used, shared, and disposed for all PII should be  maintained  to  establish  accountability  and  compliance  with  regulations.  Developers must  establish  a  process  to  detect  and  comply  with  privacy  and  security  laws  and regulatory requirements applicable to their business and retain documented evidence of their  compliance.  Developers  must  establish  and  abide  by  their  privacy  policy  for customer  consent  and  data  rights  to  access,  rectify,  erase,  or  stop  sharing/processing their information where applicable or required by data privacy regulation. Developer must have  technical  and  organizational  processes  and  systems  in  place  for  assisting Authorized Users with data subject access requests. Developers must include contractual provisions  in  employment  contracts  with  employees  that  process  PII  to  maintain confidentiality of PII</p>
<p><br></p>

<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">3.3 ASSET MANAGEMENT</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers must maintain baseline standard configuration for the  information  system  and  keep  inventory  of  software  and  physical  assets  (e.g. computers, mobile devices) with access to PII, and update quarterly. Physical assets that store, process, or otherwise handle PII must abide by all of the requirements set forth in this  policy.  Developers  must  not  store  PII  in  removable  media,  personal  devices,  or unsecured  public  cloud  applications  (e.g.,  public  links  made  available  through  Google Drive)  unless  it  is  encrypted  using  at  least  AES-128  or  RSA-2048  bit  keys  or  higher. Developers must securely dispose of any printed documents containing PII. Developer must  implement  data  loss  prevention  (DLP)  controls  in  place  to  monitor  and  detect unauthorized movement of data.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">3.4 ENCRYPTION AT REST</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers must encrypt all PII at rest using at least AES-128 or   RSA   with   2048-bit   key   size   or   higher.   The   cryptographic   materials   (e.g., encryption/decryption keys) and cryptographic capabilities (e.g. daemons implementing virtual  Trusted  Platform  Modules  and  providing  encryption/decryption  APIs)  used  for encryption  of  PII  at  rest  must  be  only  accessible  to  the  Developer's  processes  and services.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">3.5 SECURE CODING PRACTICES</span></p>
<p><br></p>

Sensitive credentials must not be exposed in public code repositories. Developers must maintain separate test and production environments</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">3.6 LOGGING AND MONITORING</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers  must  gather  logs  to  detect  security-related events to their Applications and systems including success or failure of the event, date and time, access attempts, data changes, and system errors. Developers must implement this  logging  mechanism  on  all  channels  (e.g.,  service  APIs,  storage-layer  APIs, administrative dashboards) providing access to Information. Developers must review logs in real-time (e.g. SIEM tool) or on a bi-weekly basis. All logs must have access controls to prevent any unauthorized access and tampering throughout their lifecycle. Logs must not contain PII unless the PII is necessary to meet legal requirements, including tax or regulatory  requirements.  Unless  otherwise  required  by  applicable  law,  logs  must  be retained for at least 90 days for reference in the case of a Security Incident. Developers must build mechanisms to monitor the logs and all system activities to trigger investigative alarms on suspicious actions (e.g., multiple unauthorized calls, unexpected request rate and  data  retrieval  volume,  and  access  to  canary  data  records).  Developers  must implement monitoring alarms and processes to detect if Information is extracted from or can be found beyond its protected boundaries. Developers should perform investigation when monitoring alarms are triggered, and this should be documented in the Developer's Incident Response Plan.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p class="subtitle-space"><span class="subtitle">3.7 VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" class="description-paragraph description">Developers  must  create  and  maintain  a  plan  and/or runbook  to  detect  and  remediate  vulnerabilities.  Developers  must  protect  physical hardware  containing  PII  from  technical  vulnerabilities  by  performing  vulnerability  scans and remediating appropriately. Developers must conduct vulnerability scanning at least every 180 days, penetration test at least every 365 days, and scan code for vulnerabilities prior  to  each  release.  Furthermore,  Developers  must  control  changes  to  the  storage hardware by testing, verifying changes, approving changes, and restricting access to who may perform those actions. Developer must have appropriate procedures and plans to restore  availability  and  access  to  PII  in  a  timely  manner  in  the  event  of  a  physical  or technical incident.</p>
